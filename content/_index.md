This is the website for the Decision Boundary Map (DBM) technique. Here you can find high-resolution images for the experiments published in the related papers. As the research on the subject evolves, results of other experiments and different datasets will be published here, as well and the code for creating DBMs.

The following papers were published about DBMs:

+ [*Image-based visualization of classifier decision boundaries*](http://www.cs.rug.nl/~alext/PAPERS/SIBGRAPI18/paper2.pdf), by Francisco Caio M. Rodrigues, Roberto Hirata and Alexandru C. Telea, SIBGRAPI 2018

+ [*Visual Analytics of Multidimensional Projections for Constructing Classifier Decision Boundary Maps*](http://www.cs.rug.nl/~alext/PAPERS/IVAPP19/paper.pdf), by Mateus Espadoto, Francisco Caio M. Rodrigues and Alexandru C. Telea, IVAPP 2019 (Best paper award)
